I made a file compressor that runs from the command line as a short hobby project. It's not very good, and it would be pretty sad if anyone actually used this but you can download it [here](https://github.com/jptr218/algius/raw/main/algius.exe).

Usage:
`algius c a.txt b.txt`
`algius d a.txt b.txt`
